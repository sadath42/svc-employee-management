## Note
   All the methods should be written in a Seprate class ArrayUtility 
   Main program should reside in driver class

## Reverse the array
  A method which accepts the array as the paraeter and reverse all the elements
  ```
  Example 1:

   Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
   Output: [0,1,6,3]
```
## Highest in array
  A method which accepts the array as the paraeter and returns the higesht element
  ```
   Example 1:

   Input: nums = [3,6,1,0,8,5,8]
   Output: 8
```


## twice Largest Number

Create a class with method which finds the largest number with below criteria  

You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.

``` 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
 ```
